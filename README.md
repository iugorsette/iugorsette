## Hi, I’m Sette 👋

Software Developer focused on **building scalable and well-structured systems**, working across frontend, backend, mobile, and cloud.

I have strong experience with **JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems** (Angular, Node.js), and I’m constantly expanding my skill set by exploring **Flutter/Dart**, **Java with Spring Boot**, and **cloud-native architectures** (GCP and beyond).

I value strong fundamentals, clean architecture, and adaptability over being tied to a single stack.

### 🛠 Core Expertise

- **Backend**: API design, authentication, real-time communication, data modeling  
- **Mobile**: Cross-platform development concepts  
- **Cloud & DevOps**: CI/CD, cloud services, monitoring, scalable environments  
- **Software Design**: Clean architecture, SOLID, design patterns, maintainable code

### 📚 Currently Learning & Exploring

- Cloud-native architecture and distributed systems  
- Deeper backend concepts with **Spring Boot**  
- Cross-platform mobile development with **Flutter**  
- Improving system design and scalability skills
